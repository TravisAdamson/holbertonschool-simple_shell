NAME
       shellshock - A shockingly good shell

SYNOPSIS
       shellshock

DESCRIPTION
       You have been Shellshocked! Shellshocked is a super cool shell program
       that allows you to execute commands and navigate through your system
       using a command-line interface. It provides a stylish and interactive
       shell experience with additional cool features to make your terminal
       sessions awesome!

       Once the cool shell is running, you can enter commands as you would in
       a regular shell. Shellshocked supports basic commands such as `ls`,
       `pwd`, `cd`, and more. You can also use environmental variables by
       typing `$VAR_NAME` to access their values. To exit the shell, use the
       `exit` command.

       The shell is compiled using the GCC compiler with the following cool
       flags for strict error checking and style:
       gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

       Shellshocked includes cool unit tests to ensure its functionalities are
       working correctly. To run the tests, use the following command:
       make test

       To check for memory leaks in the cool shell, use Valgrind with the
       following command:
       valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes --show-leak-kinds=all
       ./hsh

       Enjoy the cool shell and have a blast with your terminal adventures!
       Happy hacking!
